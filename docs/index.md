# The JavaScript Catalog Project


## Overview

This site provides documentation of the JavaScript Catalog project run by
members of [Security and Privacy Research at Illinois](//sprai.org). The project
conducts website crawls and collects a wide range of data, focusing on (but not
limited to) the JavaScript executed by a webpage.

Although this site is under construction, it should provide a useful overview
for those wishing to use data or conduct crawls.
